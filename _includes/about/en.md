## About Me

Tarek, Bachelor’s degree in Management information systems, Passionate about Business, Data and Entrepreneurship. A Web Science master’s degree student. 

I like to be the bridge Between Tech and Business, a person who enjoys using the data to building/improving products, products that are used by thousands of people, products that can solve problems in their life. 

I try to be a guy who can solve everything with anything. Like if there’s a problem You’re the guide to solve it, No matter if it’s a technical problem, a business problem I want to be the guy that people can depend on and that’s the person that I’m trying to be.
