## About Me

Hello everyone,

I'm excited to introduce myself as your new colleague! My name is TAREK CHIKH ALSHABAB, a 28-year-old Syrian guy, from Damascus. I'm working at the IFRC as a Data Analytics, based in Geneva.

My educational journey has taken me through the Syrian Virtual University, where I obtained an MSc. in Web of Science, and the Arab International University, where I completed a B.Sc. in Management Information Systems. These academic experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in data engineering, programming, and data analysis.

With over 4 years of professional experience, I have honed my skills in designing and implementing data pipelines and warehouses, ensuring the efficient collection, cleaning, and analysis of large-scale datasets. Python and SQL are my go-to languages for manipulating and extracting insights from data, while PostgreSQL and MongoDB serve as my preferred database tools.

Having worked right now at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I have had the privilege of collaborating with colleagues from different regions, guiding data collection standards, and generating insightful analysis reports. My time at the Syrian Arab Red Crescent involved managing data pipelines and warehouses, enabling the distribution of relief items to millions of beneficiaries. During my tenure at Tabo Akdar, I contributed to enhancing user experiences through web development using PHP Laravel and Bootstrap.

In my personal life, I'm a big fan of hiking, running, and playing the guitar. I'm also interested in learning new languages and traveling the world. I'm excited to use data for good.
