IFRC Data & Digital Week 2021

How great is it to automate your work, and increase your efficiencies?  
In this session, we would like to share with you our experiences in the IM department on SARC. how we use the latest data science tools and open-source tech to build an automating process for collection, processing, analysis, visualization, and sharing our data from our +100 Warehouse and +1M distribution of items for more than 3.5 million beneficiaries around Syria.

When we build the solutions we keep in mind that we want to build sustainable ones, we want to increase the IM's department efficiency with as minimal coding as possible.
