Spike it’s an online platform that makes AI accessible for all businesses, governments and other enterprises.

Every business needs artificial intelligence.  
But not every business has the capability to build, maintain, and generate value from AI in-house.  
Spike makes AI accessible for all businesses, governments and other enterprises.

By harnessing the power of your data to assist – not displace – humans at work, we improve business efficiency and productivity.

And all of that will be provided with:  
1- Data warehouse  
2- Interactive Analytics  
3- Prediction and forecasting report.

With:  
\* No AI or machine learning experience required.  
\* No infrastructure needed.  
\* Supporting the MENA region and we are less expensive for other solutions.

Spike was my graduation project too from Business Administration/ Management Information Technology department of the Arab International University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Business Administration
