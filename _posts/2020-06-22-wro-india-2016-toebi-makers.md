## What is WRO Open Category? what is WRO?

The World Robot Olympiad (WRO) is a global robotics competition for young people. The World Robot Olympiad competition uses Lego Mindstorms manufactured by LEGO Education. First held in 2004 in Singapore, it now attracts more than 26,000 teams from more than 65 countries.

The Open Category is a project based competition. Students create their own intelligent robotics solution relating to the current theme of the season. Teams will present their project and their robot model to a group of judges on the competition day.

## TOEBI Makers - A robot that makes compost for us with a mobile app

this out presentation script for the my students for the project, I thinks it's the best way to explain the project:

**Mirna**  
Hello everyone, I'm so glad to have you all in here today.  
We're The Toebi makers team,  
I'm Mirna this is Eaz and Hussam with our project the compost machine.  

Do you know that 50% of the world produced food is wasted every year, what equals  to 400 billion dollars each year.  
We have a waste management problem and we're here to give you the solution.  
Compost Machine!  
Why do you need to have a compost machine?

  
**Eaz**  
Earth is dying, and organic waste decomposition releases harmful gases such as methane and ammonia leading to greenhouse effect, diseases and climate change.

So toebi is here to solve the problem by managing this waste and making fertilizers out of it.  
This fertilizer is our compost, a mixture of rich nutrients such as Carbon and nitrogen with a little bit of water and air.

But how does it work?  

**Hussam**  
Our compost machine is fully automated. You just need to put the materials and let the magic begin. It is as simple as it looks  
Two shredders, one for newspapers, cartons, dry leaves and wood chips where we can get carbon from, and the second  is for getting the nitrogen from materials such as old vegetables, tossed fruits or anything organic.  
  
The smaller the pieces are the faster the process of decomposing will be.  
  
**Mirna**  
Moreover, to get an eligible compost you need the right C:N ratio, and that happens when the materials goes to the Temporary Storage.  
A phase where the right amounts of nitrogen and carbon are measured because, too much nitrogen might raise the acidity of the compost and releases a repellant smell and too much carbon would slow down the process.

Our app will help to know the right C:N ratio, you just have to choose the materials you put and an average amount of them 

We will know if the temporary storage is full by using the ultrasonic sensor, and according to the amount the storages under doors will open mechanically. This is when the materials go down to the bucket where the decomposition phase is going to start.

**Hussam**  
Both of the materials will be in the bucket, once they're in, the humidity sensor will check if the value is between 40-60%, if it was less than 40 the washer will immediately work and moisturize them, and if more than 60, the arm will mix them so the water will get down in the plastic bags inside the bucket. And guess what! This water can be used to the plants and it's really healthy for them.

The mixing process is essential, oxygen is required for the aerobic decomposition that's why the arm will work every other day.

**Eaz**  
All the codes that every process have / is connected together to make toebi automated, starting from the shredders, to the temporary storages which we used bluetooth connection to send the sensor value and the average amount which the user has entered and calculate it in our application in aim to reach the right C:N ratio

Then we have the bucket, Everything in the bucket is connected to the Arduino controller where all the data will be send.

We thought that we should know when the water in the washer is going to end that's why we used a voltage divider to determine the water level as water resistance will change.

Plus, we made a voltage divider circuit that consist of two resistors in a series to divide and bring the input voltage within the Arduino analog inputs range.

But how would you know more about all those the details? Mirna will tell us… 

**Mirna**  
The best thing we did is that we made toebi connected to the cloud, which means that it has a mobile application to send you all the details like battery and water level, the end time for your compost and moisturize continent ..  
Which means you have to download the app for your compost machine!

Now lets imagine that we'll have toebi applied in the streets in the future in various sizes according to the place. As it have an IP address it will send the data to the trash cars when it's  full and the compost is ready, so the trash cars won’t come to find that its still empty, and we made it able to move so that when the trash cars will come they won't need anyone to move the trash and it also saves energy for the cars.

**Eaz**  
It started from thoughts and ideas we shared together and step by step we made this project to make a change in the world we live in,  
because we realized how important the matter is.

With our real solution, with no simulation more people will help to recycle organic waste and more countries will be able to plant crops and have food security because the nutrients in the compost can rebuild the soil. 

Our project can rebuild the countries around the world.

To a greener future we'll rebuild our agriculture.

Thank you.
