The AUB AI for Accessibility Hackathon is an exciting event that brings together talented individuals and fosters the development of the innovative entrepreneurship community in the field of Artificial Intelligence. With a strong focus on social inclusiveness, this hackathon aims to provide solutions for people with disabilities, particularly those falling under assistive technologies or physical aids.

As a passionate advocate for leveraging technology to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities, I participated in the AUB AI for Accessibility Hackathon with great enthusiasm. Recognizing the immense potential of AI in addressing accessibility challenges, I joined a team of like-minded individuals who shared a common goal of creating impactful solutions.

During the hackathon, our team focused on developing a non-standard speech-to-text tool with Arabic language support. Our vision was to build a Software as a Service (SAAS) solution that could be easily integrated into various applications, allowing developers to implement our tool and make a positive difference in the lives of people with speech impairments.

The core idea behind our solution was to utilize AI algorithms to optimize voice recordings in Arabic and other languages, transforming non-standard speech into standard speech. By doing so, we aimed to enhance the accuracy and user experience of speech-to-text tools, making it easier for individuals with speech impairments to express themselves effectively.

By participating in the AUB AI for Accessibility Hackathon, we had the opportunity to collaborate with experienced mentors, attend workshops, and receive valuable feedback on our proposed solution. The hackathon not only provided us with a platform to showcase our innovative ideas but also encouraged us to think critically about the needs of individuals with disabilities and explore how AI can address those needs.

Moving forward, we plan to continue refining our solution and exploring avenues for its implementation in real-world scenarios. We believe that by providing developers with access to our SAAS tool and promoting its integration into various applications, we can create a more inclusive and accessible world for individuals with speech impairments.

The AUB AI for Accessibility Hackathon served as an inspiring platform for individuals passionate about harnessing the power of AI to address accessibility challenges. By participating in this hackathon, I had the privilege of collaborating with a talented team, refining our proposed solution, and envisioning a future where technology plays a transformative role in improving the lives of individuals with disabilities.
