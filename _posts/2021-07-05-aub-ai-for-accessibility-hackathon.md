Our main competitor is Speech Generation Devices, which lack good user experience and is considered to be an old highly cost technology. Through our proposed AI solution, we will provide a better user experience for users.

We are willing to scale by building the non-standard speech optimization core that will be used as a base for any product with any size, including our smart SGD, and we will provide a paid API for developers, so they can use our service in their own solutions.

This project is done with great team:
