**Bit Code** is an online platform that allows people to learn how to programming web applications and mobile apps in an awesome interactive way, and all that will be available in the Arabic language and free of charge.

We got 3,500 registered users in the first 4 months after the website launched.  
BitCode got investments from Oasis500, Jordan. and won the 1st place in Jusoor entrepreneurship competition in 2016.

**What's the problem that we’re trying to solve?**

In 2020 programming-related employment will rise about 22% and that will offer more than 1.4 million jobs in computer science that two times what tech companies need today, and there is only 1 of 10 schools in the USA teach children how to code, so clearly the future need more programmer, at the same time Arabic content and documentation for programming languages is still very poor and far from professional. 

**Who is your target market?**

We target young Arabs who have an interest in programming, our target market is mostly about 15-23 years old in countries that have low education level in MENA and GCC region for now.

**What’s your solution to the problem?**

We provide learning how to programming in an awesome interactive way, we won’t provide any quizzes or question that student has to answer, instead, the student will write the code himself directly into the site and make the code step by step, and when he finishes challenges he will earn points, badges and he will be able to share it with his friends in social media.

**How is the solution that you are providing innovative?**

The main idea of Bit Code is the interactive way to get the courses the student will write his code into the site directly and step by step to learn by doing, that is a much better way to learn to code, not just watching long videos or boring examples that you don’t really need, and he can learn with his friends, they can share their points, and badges he’ll get when finishing challenges via social media.

**What is the difference between Coursera, edx, and other MOOC platforms with Bit Code?**

Coursera, edx and other MOOC platform provide a lot of subjects and courses, however in Bit Code we’re just focusing on programming web application and mobile apps, and we provide that in an awesome interactive way, we won’t provide any quizzes, or question that the learner has to answer, instead we’ll let the learner write the code himself directly into the site and make him build his apps step by step, and when he finishes challenges he’ll earn points, badges and share it with his friends in social media, and all that will be available in the Arabic language.
