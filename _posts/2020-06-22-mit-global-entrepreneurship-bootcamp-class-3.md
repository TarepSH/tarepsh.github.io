What is MIT Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp?

The Bootcamp will be the most intense education experience of your life.  
Throughout the program, Bootcampers learn and practice a variety of new skills related to entrepreneurship and innovation, both from MIT faculty, MIT coaches, and guest speakers as well as through their experiences in project teams. Each Bootcamper has the opportunity to be CEO, leading the team through its project work for a day. In one week, the Bootcamp provides participants many experiences most entrepreneurs and innovators face in the first 2-3 years of a new venture.
